# ***Important Note***

- ðŸ“„ When uploading the PDF, it is encouraged to choose **high-quality, text-based PDFs** rather than image-based or scanned PDFs. Our current prototype is optimized for extracting and reading text from the document.

- ðŸ“š For better results, try uploading **one chapter at a time**. This helps the AI process the content more effectively and generate higher-quality quizzes.

- ðŸŽ‰ Have fun trying out our quiz generator! If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to **contact me** anytime.
